# SuperHive

##About

HIVE mod for improved gameplay. Developed by quantumpotato, ChrisCauley, RookieOne.
Original game pieces by John Yianni and Gen42. Special thanks to Board Game Geek Hive Community for the alternate Spider rules. More variant discussion: https://boardgamegeek.com/forum/14694/hive/variants

##Why?

HIVE is a fantastic game with a few oddities. This mod intends to address imbalances in piece strength and open up strategic possibilities.

##Contested Stacks and Deploys

###Rule

When a stack of bugs contains bugs from opposite teams, (like the Beetle), that hex is now considered "Neutral" for sake of bug deployment. The hex does not affect bug deployment in its adjacent tiles.

###Example

W>B: White bug stacked on black bug
B>W: Black bug stacked on white bug

![Stack](/examples/stack.png)

1: White can deploy
2: White can deploy
3: Black can deploy
4: Black can deploy
5: White + Black can deploy
6: No player can deploy - no player controls an adjacent hex.

###Why?

Proxy deployment off Beetles was too strong. After a few turns of crawling your beetle on top of enemy Queen you could attack directly 1 Bug / turn.


##Beetle

###Rule

Beetles can crawl between two pieces to move, provided they do not break the Hive.

###Example

![Stack](/examples/beetle.png)

Beetle can move to X because the remaining Bugs form a link.

###Why?

Beetle movement felt restricted moving in a sliding only fashion.

##Grasshopper

###Rule

Grasshoppers can make unlimited jumps.

###Why?

Grasshopper is a cool piece but lacking mobility. They are now tremendously mobile but given the right counter deployment, their movement patterns can be blocked by placing or moving a piece just such that the Grasshopper cannot land where they need to.

##Spider

###Rule

Spider moves 2 tiles on the hive, then steps off.

###Why?

Spiders are no longer weak Soldier Ants. They now have a unique movement and threat pattern.


##Spider Web

###Rule

Soldier Ants must take the shortest route to their path.
If a Soldier Ant collides with an enemy Spider en route, they stop there.
A Soldier Ant is not affected by webs of enemy Spiders they begin their turn adjacent to.

###Why?

A direct counter to mobility of Soldier Ants. Being able to deploy Spiders next to your Queen is a viable opening for stopping Soldier Ant rushes.

##Expanded Board Variant

###About

This isn't tested very much and is separate from the above rules.

###Rule

Start the game with both Mosquito tiles facedown and adjacent.

###Why?

This removes the conflicting rule of deploying a bug must be next to your own bugs except on Turn 1.
